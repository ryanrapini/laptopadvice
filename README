Hello World!

###What do I do how do I github I am not a clever man.

Just edit index.markdown. That's all you need to edit. Don't touch any of the other files. Don't even look at them in fact.

If you're not familiar with markdown, go [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax/) or just use your brain its really pretty intuitive you can even just use HTML if you get confused or whatever.
