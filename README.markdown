Hello World!

###What do I do how do I github I am not a clever man.

Just edit the files in the main directory that end with '.markdown'. That's all you need to edit. Don't touch any of the other files. Don't even look at them in fact.

If you're not familiar with markdown, go [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax/) or just use your brain its really pretty intuitive you can even just use HTML if you get confused or whatever.

Obviously each of the files corresponds to a page on the site by the same name hopefully you've figured that out by now it's pretty intuitive.
